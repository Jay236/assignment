<h2>Maserati</h2>  
  <p>Say “gib-lee.” It’s named for an African desert wind—and the perfect name for a hot Italian sedan. With its deliciously curved lines, the Ghibli’s looks are backed up by what’s under the hood. The base setup is a 345-hp, twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 and rear-wheel drive; the S performance version has 404 hp and optional all-wheel drive. Both engines have an eight-speed automatic. The interior needs nicer materials, but this desert wind is a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by German sedans.</p>

<body>
<p>Rushing sausages to market before they’re fully cured has long been standard operating procedure at the Italian salumerie. Your humble author continues to serve on the testing and development team (otherwise known as the owner body) for the Lamborghini Espada—36 years after the car went out of production. And for decades, Maserati has been another punch line that proves the rule.

<p>Again, why choose this Italian over a German? Or even the fabulous new Cadillac CTS Vsport? There have to be reasons if, as Maserati indicated with its Super Bowl ad, it plans to take down the giants. But the Ghibli doesn’t yet offer enough of them. It needs a little more development time and a lot more la vita Italiana.
