<h2>Bentley Continental</h2>
The Bentley Continental GT was conceived, designed and built for that rare breed of person who refuses to let a single experience pass them by. It is everything a Grand Tourer should be, embodying a unique blend of exquisite style, craftsmanship and exhilaration. Available as a Coupé or Convertible, it is at the same time both powerful and sophisticated. The interior and exterior design create a sense of luxury that, combined with a remarkable driving experience, make it unlike any other car.

<body>
    <p>The Crewe styling team has created a Bentley coupé of elegantly tailored lines and muscular form, with the precise crease of the front wings shaped by Superforming technology. Distinctive large, close-set inner headlamps, ringed by jewel-like LED lights, sit either side of the wide chrome grille. At the rear, Bentley’s signature ‘floating’ LED lights draw ones eye to the extremities of the car, emphasising its low, wide stance.</p>

    <p>These sharp, contemporary lines are only achievable thanks to Bentley’s state-of-the-art facilities and its life-long commitment to producing coach-built cars featuring exquisite details. Each bodyline, crease and swell of bodywork has a look of millimetre-perfect precision. A sweeping bodyline spears backwards from the front wheel to meet the muscular curve of the rear wheel’s haunch, projecting a wide and confident stance. Superforming, a technique that uses a combination of 450ºC temperature and air pressure, is used to form the Continental GT’s immaculately tailored lines.</p>
