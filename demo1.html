    <h3>Rolls Royce</h3> 
   This is Grand Touring redefined for the modern-day seeker. Restless in spirit, confident in style. When experiences are the only 
   currency by which success should be measured, Wraith combines Power, Style and Drama for the ultimate GT encounter.

    <p>The Crewe styling team has created a Bentley coupé of elegantly tailored lines and muscular form, with the precise crease of the front wings shaped by Superforming technology. Distinctive large, close-set inner headlamps, ringed by jewel-like LED lights, sit either side of the wide chrome grille. At the rear, Bentley’s signature ‘floating’ LED lights draw ones eye to the extremities of the car, emphasising its low, wide stance.</p>

<p>The romantic notion of Grand Touring ends here. Wraith is a motor car that goes beyond what is expected. What is known. 
   It delivers a truly unmistakable, spirited drive unlike any other. This is new world beauty with GT brawn.</p>
